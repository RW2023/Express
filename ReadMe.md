# Express

This repository contains code and projects for an Express app, created as part of the Web Developer Bootcamp 2023, an online course by Colt Steele on Udemy.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a resource for learning how to build a basic web application using Express, a popular Node.js web framework. All code and projects are provided for educational purposes only and should not be used for any commercial or production purposes.

## Contents

The repository contains code and projects for building a basic web application using Express, including:

- Setting up a basic Express server
- Creating and using routes
- Working with middleware
- Using templates to render views
- Interacting with a database (MongoDB) using Mongoose

Each section of the course includes multiple projects and exercises that build upon the skills learned in the previous sections.

## Getting Started

To use this repository, you will need to have a basic understanding of web development and programming concepts, as well as some experience working with Node.js. You will also need to have the necessary tools and software installed on your computer, such as a text editor and web browser.

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine using your preferred method (e.g. Git CLI or GitHub Desktop). From there, you can explore the code and projects in each section of the course.

To run the Express app locally, navigate to the project directory in a terminal window and run the `node app.js` command. The app will listen for incoming requests on port 3000 by default, so you can access it in your web browser by navigating to `http://localhost:3000/`.
